            For as long as I can remember I have been interested in development.
            I built my first website at the age of 9, and created a whole
            virtual airline app to integrate with Microsoft Flight Simulator by
            age 13. What was then a mere hobby has blossomed into a career with
            my recent completion from Prime Digital Academyâ€™s Full Stack
            Software Development course.

            I have been a professional touring musician, pilot and heavily
            involved in the restaurant scene all my life. I am so excited to be
            pivoting back into development and would love to mix my passion for
            aviation with my new career in tech.
